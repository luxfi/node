# Snowman to Consensus/Chain Migration Status

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Updated Imports
- ✅ Replaced `snow/consensus/snowman` imports with `consensus/chain`
- ✅ Updated all `snowman.Block` references to `chain.Block`
- ✅ Updated warp package to use new chain types

### 2. Updated Geth Module
- ✅ Updated plugin/evm/vm.go to use consensus/chain
- ✅ Updated plugin/evm/block.go to implement chain.Block interface
- ✅ Updated atomic/tx.go interfaces
- ✅ Updated warp/backend.go BlockClient interface
- ✅ Created and pushed v0.15.5 tag

### 3. Removed Replace Directives
- ✅ Removed all local replace directives from go.mod files
- ✅ Updated to use proper tagged versions

## Current Issues

### Geth Module Compilation Errors
The geth module has several compatibility issues that need to be resolved:

1. **Mixed imports from go-ethereum and luxfi/geth**
   - ethdb package conflicts
   - Need to fully replace go-ethereum imports with luxfi/geth equivalents

2. **Interface compatibility issues**
   - Metrics interfaces expecting pointers instead of interfaces
   - Log handler compatibility between different slog versions

3. **Missing method implementations**
   - Database interfaces missing required methods
   - Type assertion failures

## Next Steps

1. Fix geth module to properly wrap all go-ethereum dependencies
2. Ensure all imports use only luxfi/geth types, not go-ethereum types
3. Update interface implementations to match expected signatures
4. Test build across all modules (geth, evm, netrunner, cli, node)
5. Run integration tests with 5-node network

## Build Commands

To build with private repositories:
```bash
export GOPRIVATE=github.com/luxfi/*
make build
```

## Notes

- The Makefile has been updated to include Go bin directory in PATH
- Protobuf generation tools are now properly cached
- The consensus refactoring from snowman to chain package is architecturally complete
- Implementation issues remain in the geth module that need to be addressed
