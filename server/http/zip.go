// Serving a zip app on this router.
//
// A zip app owns a listener: zip.Serve is what starts one, and it is also what
// installs the projections of the app's typed ops — the OpenAPI document, the
// docs page, the MCP door, the op-call plane. Taking the app's request handler
// any other way serves the ops and none of the rest, and zip exports no verb
// that installs them without serving.
//
// So the app IS served, on a transport whose wire is the listener this process
// already has: zip hands the transport the app's request handler, the transport
// parks instead of binding, and Mount copies each net/http request onto it. The
// copy is written out because fasthttp ships the other direction only
// (fasthttpadaptor.NewFastHTTPHandler). It costs one request-sized copy per
// call, which an API route can afford.
