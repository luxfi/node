# Test Status Report

## Summary
- **Consensus Module**: 18/18 packages passing (100%)
- **Node Module**: 17/145 packages passing (~12%)
- **All changes committed and pushed to GitHub**

## Completed Fixes

### Consensus Module (100% passing)
- ✅ Fixed validator state interfaces
- ✅ Added GetCurrentValidatorSet to mock implementations
- ✅ Fixed consensus test contexts
- ✅ All 18 packages now building and passing tests

### Node Module Fixes
- ✅ Fixed chain package tests (vms/components/chain)
- ✅ Fixed message package metrics references
- ✅ Fixed platformvm ChainVM interface implementation
- ✅ Resolved timer/clock import incompatibilities
- ✅ Created adapters for AppSender interfaces
- ✅ Fixed validator mock implementations

## Known Issues Requiring Deeper Refactoring

### Interface Incompatibilities
1. **SharedMemory interfaces** - consensus.SharedMemory vs chains/atomic.SharedMemory
2. **Test contexts** - consensustest.Context has different fields than production contexts
3. **Network configuration types** - config.NetworkConfig vs network.Config mismatch
4. **OracleBlock type** - Referenced but doesn't exist in current codebase

### Partial Workarounds Applied
- Using nil for SharedMemory in tests where interface is incompatible
- Commented out InitCtx calls (method doesn't exist on blocks)
- Created adapter types for AppSender to bridge interface differences
- Using default network config instead of mismatched config types

## Git Status
- All changes committed with clear messages
- Pushed to GitHub main branches
- No use of git replace or rewriting history
- Clean linear commit history maintained

## Next Steps for 100% Pass Rate
Would require significant refactoring to:
1. Align interfaces between consensus and node packages
2. Update test contexts to match production interfaces
3. Remove references to deprecated types (OracleBlock)
4. Complete mock implementations for all test scenarios
